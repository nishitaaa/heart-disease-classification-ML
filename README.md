This project explores various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in order to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

We'll use pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy for data anaylsis, as well as, Scikit-Learn for machine learning and modelling tasks.

The project first goes through exploratory data analysis (EDA). The data is then trained, tested, and compared using the 3 different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
